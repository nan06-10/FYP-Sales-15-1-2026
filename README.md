# Overview
This project transforms raw, messy sales data into actionable business insights. By applying data science techniques, I analyzed transaction patterns to understand how a business actually functions—helping to identify peak performance times, popular products, and operational bottlenecks.

This tool provides data-driven evidence needed to make smarter business decisions

Key Features & Insights
* **Trend Analysis:** Visualized sales cycles to identify daily and monthly peak hours.
* **Product Performance:** Ranked inventory items to see which products drive the most revenue.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Identified low-activity periods where resources could be optimized or costs reduced.
* **Automated Data Cleaning:** Built a pipeline to handle missing data and formatting errors automatically.

Technical Aspects
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas (Data Manipulation), Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data Visualization), NumPy (Numerical Analysis)
* **Platform:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks
